              Introduction to services and dependency injection
            </h1>
            <p>
              Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or
              feature that an application needs. A service is typically a class
              with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something
              specific and do it well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Angular distinguishes components from services to increase
              modularity and reusability. Ideally, a component's job is to
              enable only the user experience. A component should present
              properties and methods for data binding to mediate between the
              view and the application logic. The view is what the template
              renders and the application logic is what includes the notion of a
              model.
            </p>
            <p>
              A component should use services for tasks that don't involve the
              view or application logic. Services are good for tasks such as
              fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging
              directly to the console. By defining such processing tasks in an
              injectable service class, you make those tasks available to any
              component. You can also make your application more adaptable by
              injecting different providers of the same kind of service, as
              appropriate in different circumstances. Angular doesn't enforce
              these principles.<br />
              Instead, Angular helps you follow these principles by making it
              easy to factor your application logic into services. In Angular,
              dependency injection makes those services available to components.
